Subject: Re: Follow-Up on Job Offer and Joining Confirmation

Dear Jebina Nasrin,

Thank you for following up and for the kind gesture. I truly appreciate the opportunity offered by Softex Solution, and it’s encouraging to know you are also from Chittagong—it feels more welcoming.

I haved informed my salary expection to sir. mahmood Nabi and as you are from chittagong, i think you well infomed about the living expense of our city. I have confident enough that i can contribute to the progress of the company more than then my expected salary. 

I would be happy to move forward promptly if this works.

Warm regards,
Abdullah Al Mamoon
